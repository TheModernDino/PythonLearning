# Challenge from edabit.com
# Title: Convert Age to Days
# Complexity: Very easy
# Description: Create a function that converts age to days
# Condition: Use 365 as number of days per year
# For further challenge, creat functions on the ff: 
#   - Accept an input for age
#   - Determine year of birth in computing age
#   - determine if year is leap yr, use 366 else use 365

def check_if_leap_yr(year)
    if year % 400 == 0:
       days = 366
       if year % 100 == 0:
          days = 365
       elif year % 4 == 0:
          days = 366
       else
          days = 365
    else:
        days = 365
